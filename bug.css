The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with multiple units. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine, but `width: calc(50% + 20px + 10em);` might produce unexpected results in different browsers or screen sizes. This is because `calc()` has issues with combining percentages with fixed units, especially when there are multiple fixed units involved.  The browser's rendering engine may have trouble accurately calculating the final width because of the order of operations and unit conversions.
